# jable-helper

## Features

- Show related works by **real series metadata** (from `r18.dev`) on video pages.
- Mobile-friendly floating panel: safe-area spacing + collapse/expand support on small screens.
- Filter out series items that do not exist on `jable.tv` to avoid dead links.

## Script File

- `jable-helper.user.js`
